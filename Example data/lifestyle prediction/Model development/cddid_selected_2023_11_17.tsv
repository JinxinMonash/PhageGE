This model represents XerC, one of two closely related chromosomal proteins along with XerD (TIGR02225). XerC and XerD are site-specific recombinases which help resolve chromosome dimers to monomers for cell division after DNA replication. In species with a large chromosome and homologs of XerC on other replicons, the chomosomal copy was preferred for building this model. This model does not detect all XerC, as some apparent XerC examples score in the gray zone between trusted (450) and noise (410) cutoffs, along with some XerD examples.

This family belongs to the phage integrase family (pfam00589) that also includes recombinases XerC (TIGR02224) and XerD (TIGR02225), which are bacterial housekeeping proteins. Within this family of integron integrases, some are designated by class, e.g. IntI4, a class 4 integron integrase from Vibrio cholerae N16961.

271174	cd00217	INT_Flp_C	Flp Tyrosine-based site-specific recombinases (also called integrases), C-terminal catalytic domain. Yeast Flp-like recombinases mediate the amplification of the 2 micron circular plasmid copy number by catalyzing the intra-molecular recombination between two inverted repeats during replication. They belong to the DNA breaking-rejoining enzyme superfamily, which also includes prokaryotic tyrosine recombinases and type IB topoisomerases. These enzymes share the same fold in their catalytic domain containing six conserved active site residues and the overall reaction mechanism. Flp-like recombinases are almost exclusively found in yeast and are highly diverged in sequence from the prokaryotic tyrosine recombinases. They cleave their target DNA in trans with a composite active site in which the catalytic tyrosine is provided by a promoter bound to a site other than the one being cleaved. Thus each active site within Flp complexes is assembled by domain swapping and contains catalytic residues from two different monomers. Two DNA segments are synapsed by the tetrameric enzyme, carrying the nucleophilic tyrosine in each active site with only two of the four monomers active at a given time. The catalytic domain is linked through a flexible loop to the N-terminal domain, which is largely responsible for non-specific DNA binding and isomerization. Its overall fold is similar to the SAM domain fold also found in the N-terminal domains of lambda integrase and XerD recombinase.	410	1	0	1	0	0	0	1	5	0	1	1
133136	cd00303	retropepsin_like	Retropepsins; pepsin-like aspartate proteases. The family includes pepsin-like aspartate proteases from retroviruses, retrotransposons and retroelements, as well as eukaryotic dna-damage-inducible proteins (DDIs), and bacterial aspartate peptidases. While fungal and mammalian pepsins are bilobal proteins with structurally related N and C-terminals, retropepsins are half as long as their fungal and mammalian counterparts. The monomers are structurally related to one lobe of the pepsin molecule and retropepsins function as homodimers. The active site aspartate occurs within a motif (Asp-Thr/Ser-Gly), as it does in pepsin. Retroviral aspartyl protease is synthesized as part of the POL polyprotein that contains an aspartyl protease, a reverse transcriptase, RNase H, and an integrase. The POL polyprotein undergoes specific enzymatic cleavage to yield the mature proteins. In aspartate peptidases, Asp residues are ligands of an activated water molecule in all examples where catalytic residues have been identified. This group of aspartate peptidases is classified by MEROPS as the peptidase family A2 (retropepsin family, clan AA), subfamily A2A.	92	1	0	0	0	0	0	0	1	0	0	0
238206	cd00338	Ser_Recombinase	Serine Recombinase family, catalytic domain; a DNA binding domain may be present either N- or C-terminal to the catalytic domain. These enzymes perform site-specific recombination of DNA molecules by a concerted, four-strand cleavage and rejoining mechanism which involves a transient phosphoserine linkage between DNA and serine recombinase. Serine recombinases demonstrate functional versatility and include resolvases, invertases, integrases, and transposases. Resolvases and invertases (i.e. Tn3, gamma-delta, Tn5044 resolvases, Gin and Hin invertases) in this family contain a C-terminal DNA binding domain and comprise a major phylogenic group. Also included are phage- and bacterial-encoded recombinases such as phiC31 integrase, SpoIVCA excisionase, and Tn4451 TnpX transposase. These integrases and transposases have larger C-terminal domains compared to resolvases/invertases and are referred to as large serine recombinases. Also belonging to this family are proteins with N-terminal DNA binding domains similar to IS607- and IS1535-transposases from Helicobacter and Mycobacterium.	137	1	1	1	1	0	0	0	4	0	0	0
271175	cd00397	DNA_BRE_C	DNA breaking-rejoining enzymes, C-terminal catalytic domain. The DNA breaking-rejoining enzyme superfamily includes type IB topoisomerases and tyrosine based site-specific recombinases (integrases) that share the same fold in their catalytic domain containing conserved active site residues. The best-studied members of this diverse superfamily include Human topoisomerase I, the bacteriophage lambda integrase, the bacteriophage P1 Cre recombinase, the yeast Flp recombinase, and the bacterial XerD/C recombinases. Their overall reaction mechanism is essentially identical and involves cleavage of a single strand of a DNA duplex by nucleophilic attack of a conserved tyrosine to give a 3' phosphotyrosyl protein-DNA adduct. In the second rejoining step, a terminal 5' hydroxyl attacks the covalent adduct to release the enzyme and generate duplex DNA. The enzymes differ in that topoisomerases cleave and then rejoin the same 5' and 3' termini, whereas a site-specific recombinase transfers a 5' hydroxyl generated by recombinase cleavage to a new 3' phosphate partner located in a different duplex region. Many DNA breaking-rejoining enzymes also have N-terminal domains, which show little sequence or structure similarity.	167	1	0	1	0	0	0	1	5	0	1	1
238253	cd00447	NusB_Sun	RNA binding domain of NusB (N protein-Utilization Substance B) and Sun (also known as RrmB or Fmu) proteins. This family includes two orthologous groups exemplified by the transcription termination factor NusB and the N-terminal domain of the rRNA-specific 5-methylcytidine transferase (m5C-methyltransferase) Sun. The NusB protein plays a key role in the regulation of ribosomal RNA biosynthesis in eubacteria by modulating the efficiency of transcriptional antitermination. NusB along with other Nus factors (NusA, NusE/S10 and NusG) forms the core complex with the boxA element of the nut site of the rRNA operons. These interactions help RNA polymerase to counteract polarity during transcription of rRNA operons and allow stable antitermination. The transcription antitermination system can be appropriated by some bacteriophages such as lambda, which use the system to switch between the lysogenic and lytic modes of phage propagation. The m5C-methyltransferase Sun shares the N-terminal non-catalytic RNA-binding domain with NusB.	129	0	0	0	0	1	0	0	1	0	0	0
259851	cd00569	HTH_Hin_like	Helix-turn-helix domain of Hin and related proteins. This domain model summarizes a family of DNA-binding domains unique to bacteria and represented by the Hin protein of Salmonella. The basic HTH domain is a simple fold comprised of three core helices that form a right-handed helical bundle. The principal DNA-protein interface is formed by the third helix, the recognition helix, inserting itself into the major groove of the DNA. A diverse array of HTH domains participate in a variety of functions that depend on their DNA-binding properties. HTH_Hin represents one of the simplest versions of the HTH domains; the characterization of homologous relationships between various sequence-diverse HTH domain families remains difficult. The Hin recombinase induces the site-specific inversion of a chromosomal DNA segment containing a promoter, which controls the alternate expression of two genes by reversibly switching orientation. The Hin recombinase consists of a single polypeptide chain containing a C-terminal DNA-binding domain (HTH_Hin) and a catalytic domain.	42	0	0	1	0	0	0	0	1	0	0	0

271176	cd00659	Topo_IB_C	DNA topoisomerase IB, C-terminal catalytic domain. Topoisomerase I promotes the relaxation of both positive and negative DNA superhelical tension by introducing a transient single-stranded break in duplex DNA. This function is vital for the processes of replication, transcription, and recombination. Unlike Topo IA enzymes, Topo IB enzymes do not require a single-stranded region of DNA or metal ions for their function. The type IB family of DNA topoisomerases includes eukaryotic nuclear topoisomerase I, topoisomerases of poxviruses, and bacterial versions of Topo IB. They belong to the superfamily of DNA breaking-rejoining enzymes, which share the same fold in their C-terminal catalytic domain and the overall reaction mechanism with tyrosine recombinases. The C-terminal catalytic domain in topoisomerases is linked to a divergent N-terminal domain that shows no sequence or structure similarity to the N-terminal domains of tyrosine recombinases.	210	0	0	1	0	0	0	0	1	0	0	0
271177	cd00796	INT_Rci_Hp1_C	Shufflon-specific DNA recombinase Rci and Bacteriophage Hp1_like integrase, C-terminal catalytic domain. Rci protein is a tyrosine recombinase specifically involved in Shufflon type of DNA rearrangement in bacteria. The shufflon of plasmid R64 consists of four invertible DNA segments which are separated and flanked by seven 19-bp repeat sequences. RCI recombinase facilitates the site-specific recombination between any inverted repeats results in an inversion of the DNA segment(s) either independently or in groups. HP1 integrase promotes site-specific recombination of the HP1 genome into that of Haemophilus influenza. Bacteriophage Hp1_like integrases are tyrosine based site specific recombinases. They belong to the superfamily of DNA breaking-rejoining enzymes, which share the same fold in their catalytic domain and the overall reaction mechanism. The catalytic domain contains six conserved active site residues. Their overall reaction mechanism is essentially identical and involves cleavage of a single strand of a DNA duplex by nucleophilic attack of a conserved tyrosine to give a 3' phosphotyrosyl protein-DNA adduct. In the second rejoining step, a terminal 5' hydroxyl attacks the covalent adduct to release the enzyme and generate duplex DNA.	162	1	0	1	0	0	0	0	2	0	0	0

271179	cd00798	INT_XerDC_C	XerD and XerC integrases, C-terminal catalytic domains. XerDC-like integrases are involved in the site-specific integration and excision of lysogenic bacteriophage genomes, transposition of conjugative transposons, termination of chromosomal replication, and stable plasmid inheritance. They share the same fold in their catalytic domain containing six conserved active site residues and the overall reaction mechanism with the DNA breaking-rejoining enzyme superfamily. In Escherichia coli, the Xer site-specific recombination system acts to convert dimeric chromosomes, which are formed by homologous recombination to monomers. Two related recombinases, XerC and XerD, bind cooperatively to a recombination site present in the E. coli chromosome. Each recombinase catalyzes the exchange of one pair of DNA strand in a reaction that proceeds through a Holliday junction intermediate. These enzymes can bridge two different and well-separated DNA sequences called arm- and core-sites. The C-terminal domain binds, cleaves, and re-ligates DNA strands at the core-sites, while the N-terminal domain is largely responsible for high-affinity binding to the arm-type sites.	172	1	0	1	0	1	0	1	6	0	1	1

The phage attachment site is often found adjacent to the integrase gene, while the host attachment sites are typically situated near tRNA genes. This family belongs to the superfamily of DNA breaking-rejoining enzymes, which share the same fold in their catalytic domain and the overall reaction mechanism. The catalytic domain contains six conserved active site residues. Their overall reaction mechanism involves cleavage of a single strand of a DNA duplex by nucleophilic attack of a conserved tyrosine to give a 3' phosphotyrosyl protein-DNA adduct.

The TOPRIM domain has two conserved motifs, one of which centers at a conserved glutamate and the other one at two conserved aspartates (DxD).  The conserved glutamate may act as a general acid in strand cleavage by nucleases. The DXD motif may co-ordinate Mg2+, a cofactor required for full catalytic function.	97	0	0	0	0	1	0	0	1	0	0	0

259806	cd03408	SPFH_like_u1	Uncharacterized family; SPFH (stomatin, prohibitin, flotillin, and HflK/C) superfamily. This model summarizes an uncharacterized family of proteins similar to stomatin, prohibitin, flotillin, HflK/C (SPFH) and podocin. The conserved domain common to the SPFH superfamily has also been referred to as the Band 7 domain. Many superfamily members are associated with lipid rafts. Individual proteins of the SPFH superfamily may cluster to form membrane microdomains which may in turn recruit multiprotein complexes. Microdomains formed from flotillin proteins may in addition be dynamic units with their own regulatory functions. Flotillins have been implicated in signal transduction, vesicle trafficking, cytoskeleton rearrangement and are known to interact with a variety of proteins. Stomatin interacts with and regulates members of the degenerin/epithelia Na+ channel family in mechanosensory cells of Caenorhabditis elegans and vertebrate neurons and participates in trafficking of Glut1 glucose transporters. Prohibitin may act as a chaperone for the stabilization of mitochondrial proteins. Prokaryotic HflK/C plays a role in the decision between lysogenic and lytic cycle growth during lambda phage infection. Flotillins have been implicated in the progression of prion disease, in the pathogenesis of neurodegenerative diseases such as Parkinson's and Alzheimer's disease and, in cancer invasion and metastasis.

They are functionally versatile and include resolvases, invertases, integrases, and transposases. This subgroup is composed of proteins similar to the E. coli resolvase found in the par region of the RP4 plasmid, which encodes a highly efficient partitioning system. This protein is part of a complex stabilization system involved in the resolution of plasmid dimers during cell division.

They are functionally versatile and include resolvases, invertases, integrases, and transposases. Resolvases and invertases affect resolution or inversion and comprise a major phylogenic group. Resolvases (e.g. Tn3, gamma-delta, and Tn5044) normally recombine two sites in direct repeat causing deletion of the DNA between the sites. Invertases (e.g. Gin and Hin) recombine sites in inverted repeat to invert the DNA between the sites. Cointegrate resolution with gamma-delta resolvase requires the formation of a synaptosome of three resolvase dimers bound to each of two res sites on the DNA.

They are functionally versatile and include resolvases, invertases, integrases, and transposases. TndX mediates the excision and circularization of the conjugative transposon Tn5397 from Clostridium difficile. TnpX is responsible for the movement of the nonconjugative chloramphenicol resistance elements of the Tn4451/3 family.

341383	cd04610	CBS_pair_ParBc_assoc	Two tandem repeats of the cystathionine beta-synthase (CBS pair) domains associated with a ParBc (ParB-like nuclease) domain. This cd contains two tandem repeats of the cystathionine beta-synthase (CBS pair) domains associated with a ParBc (ParB-like nuclease) domain downstream. The CBS domain, named after human CBS, is a small domain originally identified in cystathionine beta-synthase and is subsequently found in a wide range of different proteins. CBS domains usually occur in tandem repeats. They associate to form a so-called Bateman domain or a CBS pair based on crystallographic studies in bacteria.  The CBS pair was used as a basis for this cd hierarchy since the human CBS proteins can adopt the typical core structure and form an intramolecular CBS pair.  The interface between the two CBS domains forms a cleft that is a potential ligand binding site. The CBS pair coexists with a variety of other functional domains and this has been used to help in its classification here.  It has been proposed that the CBS domain may play a regulatory role, although its exact function is unknown. Mutations of conserved residues within this domain are associated with a variety of human hereditary diseases, including congenital myotonia, idiopathic generalized epilepsy, hypercalciuric nephrolithiasis, and classic Bartter syndrome (CLC chloride channel family members), Wolff-Parkinson-White syndrome (gamma 2 subunit of AMP-activated protein kinase), retinitis pigmentosa (IMP dehydrogenase-1), and homocystinuria (cystathionine beta-synthase).	108	0	0	0	0	0	0	1	3	1	1	0

133137	cd05470	pepsin_retropepsin_like	Cellular and retroviral pepsin-like aspartate proteases. This family includes both cellular and retroviral pepsin-like aspartate proteases. The cellular pepsin and pepsin-like enzymes are twice as long as their retroviral counterparts. The cellular pepsin-like aspartic proteases are found in mammals, plants, fungi and bacteria. These well known and extensively characterized enzymes include pepsins, chymosin, rennin, cathepsins, and fungal aspartic proteases. Several have long been known to be medically (rennin, cathepsin D and E, pepsin) or commercially (chymosin) important. The eukaryotic pepsin-like proteases contain two domains possessing similar topological features. The N- and C-terminal domains, although structurally related by a 2-fold axis, have only limited sequence homology except in the vicinity of the active site. This suggests that the enzymes evolved by an ancient duplication event. The eukaryotic pepsin-like proteases have two active site ASP residues with each N- and C-terminal lobe contributing one residue. While the fungal and mammalian pepsins are bilobal proteins, retropepsins function as dimers and the monomer resembles structure of the N- or C-terminal domains of eukaryotic enzyme. The active site motif (Asp-Thr/Ser-Gly-Ser) is conserved between the retroviral and eukaryotic proteases and between the N-and C-terminal of eukaryotic pepsin-like proteases. The retropepsin-like family includes pepsin-like aspartate proteases from retroviruses, retrotransposons and retroelements; as well as eukaryotic DNA-damage-inducible proteins (DDIs), and bacterial aspartate peptidases. Retropepsin is synthesized as part of the POL polyprotein that contains an aspartyl-protease, a reverse transcriptase, RNase H, and an integrase. The POL polyprotein undergoes specific enzymatic cleavage to yield the mature proteins. This family of aspartate proteases is classified by MEROPS as the peptidase family A1 (pepsin A) and A2 (retropepsin family).	109	1	0	0	0	0	0	0	1	0	0	0

411808	cd09032	KH-I_N4BP1_like_rpt1	first type I K homology (KH) RNA-binding domain found in the family of NEDD4-binding protein 1 (N4BP1). The N4BP1 family includes N4BP1, NYN domain and retroviral integrase catalytic domain-containing protein (NYNRIN) and KH and NYN domain-containing protein (KHNYN). These proteins are probably of retroviral origin. N4BP1 interacts with and is a substrate of NEDD4 ubiquitin ligase (neural precursor cell expressed, developmentally downregulated 4, E3 ubiquitin protein ligase). It is also an inhibitor of the E3 ubiquitin-protein ligase ITCH, a NEDD4 structurally related E3. N4BP1 acts by interacting with the second WW domain of ITCH, leading to compete with ITCH's substrates and impairing ubiquitination of substrates. NYNRIN, also known as CGIN1/Cousin of GIN1, may contribute to retroviral resistance in mammals by regulating the ubiquitination of viral proteins. KHNYN acts as a novel cofactor for zinc finger antiviral protein (ZAP) to target CpG-containing retroviral RNA for degradation.

SETMAR also acts as a histone-lysine N-methyltransferase that methylates 'Lys-4' and 'Lys-36' of histone H3. It specifically mediates dimethylation of H3 'Lys-36' at sites of DNA double-strand break and may recruit proteins required for efficient DSB repair through non-homologous end-joining.	254	0	0	0	1	0	0	0	1	0	0	0

This model characterizes the majority of the protein; some family members may have an additional C-terminal domain that is homologous to transcriptional activators (GCR1_C). Ndc10 is part of the centromere-binding factor 3 (CBF3) complex in budding yeast. The CBF3 complex contains four essential proteins, Ndc10, Cep3, Ctf13, and Skp1. CBF3/Ndc10 is essential for the recruitment of the centromeric nucleosome and formation of the kinetochore. The Kinetochore is the large, multiprotein assembly that serves to connect condensed sister chromatids to the mitotic spindle.  Ndc10 forms a dimer and it has non-sequence-specific DNA binding activity via the DNA backbone. Ndc10 also plays an important role in the coordination of cell division.

319251	cd16393	SPO0J_N	"Thermus thermophilus stage 0 sporulation protein J-like N-terminal domain, ParB family member. Spo0J (stage 0 sporulation protein J) is a ParB family member, a critical component of the ParABS-type bacterial chromosome segregation system. The Spo0J N-terminal region acts in protein-protein interaction and is adjacent to the DNA-binding domain that binds to parS sites. Two Spo0J bind per parS site, and Spo0J interacts with neighbors via the N-terminal domain to form oligomers via an Arginine-rich patch (RRXR).  This superfamily represents the N-terminal domain of ParB, a DNA-binding component of the prokaryotic parABS partitioning system. parABS contributes to the efficient segregation of chromosomes and low-copy number plasmids to daughter cells during prokaryotic cell division. The process includes the parA (Walker box) ATPase, the ParB DNA-binding protein and a parS cis-acting DNA sites. Binding of ParB to centromere-like parS sites is followed by non-specific binding to DNA (""spreading"", which has been implicated in gene silencing in plasmid P1) and oligomerization of additional ParB molecules near the parS sites. It has been proposed that ParB-ParB cross-linking compacts the DNA, binds to parA via the N-terminal region, and leads to parA separating the ParB-parS complexes and the recruitment of the SMC (structural maintenance of chromosomes) complexes. The ParB N-terminal domain of Bacillus subtilis and other species contains a Arginine-rich ParB Box II with residues essential for bridging of the ParB-parS complexes. The arginine-rich ParB Box II consensus (I[VIL]AGERR[FYW]RA[AS] identified in several species is partially conserved with this family and related families. Mutations within the basic columns particularly debilitate spreading from the parS sites and impair SMC recruitment. The C-terminal domain contains a HTH DNA-binding motif and is the primary homo-dimerization domain, and binds to parS DNA sites. Additional homo-dimerization contacts are found along the N-terminal domain, but dimerization of the N-terminus may only occur after concentration at ParB-parS foci."	97	0	0	0	0	0	0	1	3	1	1	0

KorB is comprised of 3 domains, including a beta-strand C-terminal domain similar to SH3 domains and an alpha helical central domain that interacts with operator DNA. In ParB of P1 and SopB of F, the N-terminal region is responsible for interaction with the parA component. However, korB interaction with the RK2 parA-equivalent IncC has been mapped to the central HTH motif.  This family is related to the N-terminal domain of ParB, a DNA-binding component of the prokaryotic parABS partitioning system. parABS contributes to the efficient segregation of chromosomes and low-copy number plasmids to daughter cells during prokaryotic cell division. The process includes the parA (Walker box) ATPase, the ParB DNA-binding protein and a parS cis-acting DNA sites. Binding of ParB to centromere-like parS sites is followed by non-specific binding to DNA (""spreading"", which has been implicated in gene silencing in plasmid P1) and oligomerization of additional ParB molecules near the parS sites. It has been proposed that ParB-ParB cross-linking compacts the DNA, binds to parA via the N-terminal region, and leads to parA separating the ParB-parS complexes and the recruitment of the SMC (structural maintenance of chromosomes) complexes. The ParB N-terminal domain of Bacillus subtilis and other species contains a Arginine-rich ParB Box II with residues essential for bridging of the ParB-parS complexes. The arginine-rich ParB Box II consensus (I[VIL]AGERR[FYW]RA[AS] identified in several species is partially conserved with this family and related families. Mutations within the basic columns particularly debilitate spreading from the parS sites and impair SMC recruitment. The C-terminal domain contains a HTH DNA-binding motif and is the primary homo-dimerization domain, and binds to parS DNA sites. Additional homo-dimerization contacts are found along the N-terminal domain, but dimerization of the N-terminus may only occur after concentration at ParB-parS foci."	91	0	0	0	0	0	0	1	3	1	1	0

This family contains a Pyrococcus Furiosus enzyme reported to have DNA nuclease activity and resembles the N-terminal domain of ParB proteins of the parABS bacterial chromosome partitioning system. This sub-family also includes siderophore staphylobactin biosynthesis protein SbnI. 60% of the P. furiosus nuclease activity was retained at 90 degree C, suggesting a physiological role in the organism, which can grow in temperatures as high as 100 degrees Celsius. The protein has endo- and exo-nuclease activity vs. single- and double-stranded DNA, and nuclease activity was lost in methylated proteins prepared for structure solution. This family has a fairly well-conserved DGHHR motif that corresponds to the same structural position as the phosphorylation site (a portion of the ATP-Mg-binding site) of sulfiredoxin and the arginine-rich ParB BoxII of ParB.	72	0	0	0	0	0	0	1	3	1	1	0

426907	pfam02661	Fic	Fic/DOC family. This family consists of the Fic (filamentation induced by cAMP) protein and doc (death on curing). The Fic protein is involved in cell division and is suggested to be involved in the synthesis of PAB or folate, indicating that the Fic protein and cAMP are involved in a regulatory mechanism of cell division via folate metabolism. This family contains a central conserved motif HPFXXGNG in most members. The exact molecular function of these proteins is uncertain. P1 lysogens of Escherichia coli carry the prophage as a stable low copy number plasmid. The frequency with which viable cells cured of prophage are produced is about 10(-5) per cell per generation. A significant part of this remarkable stability can be attributed to a plasmid-encoded mechanism that causes death of cells that have lost P1. In other words, the lysogenic cells appear to be addicted to the presence of the prophage. The plasmid withdrawal response depends on a gene named doc (death on curing) that is represented by this family. Doc induces a reversible growth arrest of E. coli cells by targetting the protein synthesis machinery. Doc hosts the C-terminal domain of its antitoxin partner Phd (prevents host death) through fold complementation, a domain that is intrinsically disordered in solution but that folds into an alpha-helix on binding to Doc.This domain forms complexes with Phd antitoxins containing pfam02604.	94	0	0	0	0	1	0	0	1	0	0	0

431468	pfam10743	Phage_Cox	Regulatory phage protein cox. This family of phage Cox proteins is expressed by Enterobacteria phages. The Cox protein is a 79-residue basic protein with a predicted strong helix-turn-helix DNA-binding motif. It inhibits integrative recombination and it activates site-specific excision of the HP1 genome from the Haemophilus influenzae chromosome, Hp1. Cox appears to function as a tetramer. Cox binding sites consist of two direct repeats of the consensus motif 5'-GGTMAWWWWA, one Cox tetramer binding to each motif. Cox binding interferes with the interaction of HP1 integrase with one of its binding sites, IBS5. This competition is central to directional control. Both Cox binding sites are needed for full inhibition of integration and for activating excision, because it plays a positive role in assembling the nucleoprotein complexes that produce excisive recombination, by inducing the formation of a critical conformation in those complexes.	87	1	0	0	0	0	0	0	1	0	0	0

404040	pfam13017	Maelstrom	"piRNA pathway germ-plasm component. Maelstrom is a germ-plasm component protein, that is shown to be functionally involved in the piRNA pathway. It is conserved throughout Eukaryota, though it appears to have been lost from all examined teleost fish species. The domain architecture shows that it is coupled with several DNA- and RNA- related domains such as HMG box, SR-25-like and HDAC_interact domains. Sequence analysis and fold recognition have found a distant similarity between Maelstrom domain and the DnaQ 3'-5' exonuclease family with the RNase H fold (Exonuc_X-T, pfam00929); notably, that the Maelstrom domains from basal eukaryotes contain the conserved 3'-5' exonuclease active site residues (Asp-Glu-Asp-His-Asp, DEDHD). However, the animal and some amoeba maelstrom contain another set of conserved residues (Glu-His-His-Cys-His-Cys, EHHCHC). This evolutionary link together with structural examinations leads to the hypothesis that Maelstrom domains may have a potential nuclease-transposase activity or RNA-binding ability that may be implicated in piRNA biogenesis. A protein function evolution mode, namely ""active site switch"", has been proposed, in which the amoeba Maelstrom domains are the possible evolutionary intermediates due to their harbouring of the specific characteristics of both 3'-5' exonuclease and Maelstrom domains."	212	0	0	0	1	0	0	0	1	0	0	0

340178	pfam17463	Gp79	Gene Product 79. This is a domain of unknown function found in Mycobacterium phage. Family members include the full Gp79 protein found in Mycobacteriophage L5. Mycobacteriophage L5, is a phage isolated from Mycobacterium smegmatis. It forms stable lysogens in M. smegmatis and has a broad host range among the pathogenic mycobacteria. L5 encodes gene products (gp) toxic to the host M. smegmatis. Expression of gp79 interferes with the cell membrane or cell-wall synthesis of M. smegmatis, leading to altered cell morphology. It also has a bactericidal effect on E. coli. The N-terminal segment of gp79 (amino acids 1-41) shares sequence similarity with the signal peptide of the D-alanylD-alanine carboxypeptidase of Bacillus licheniformis. This enzyme removes C-terminal D-alanyl residues from sugarpeptide cell-wall precursors and is also a penicillin-binding protein (PBP). The homology of the hydrophobic N-terminal part of gp79 to a PBP (penicillin-binding protein) signal peptide may indicate an interaction of gp79 with proteins or metabolites involved in the peptidoglycan synthesis of M. smegmatis.	51	0	0	0	0	1	0	0	1	0	0	0

436616	pfam18607	HTH_54	ParA helix turn helix domain. The accurate segregation of DNA is essential for the faithful inheritance of genetic information. Segregation of the prototypical P1 plasmid par system requires two proteins, ParA and ParB, and a centromere. When bound to ATP, ParA mediates segregation by interacting with centromere-bound ParB, but when bound to ADP, ParA fulfills a different function: DNA-binding transcription autoregulation. ParA consists of an elongated N-terminal alpha-helix which mediates dimerization, a winged-HTH and a Walker-box containing C-domain. This entry describes the N-terminal alpha helix domain combined with the winged HTH region.	92	0	0	0	0	0	0	1	3	1	1	0
